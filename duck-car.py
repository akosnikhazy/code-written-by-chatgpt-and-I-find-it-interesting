        self.color = "yellow"
        self.sound = "quack quack"
    
    def drive(self):
        print("The duck car drives with ease.")
    
    def honk(self):
        print(self.sound)
    
# Create an instance of the DuckCar class
my_car = DuckCar()

# Call the drive and honk methods
my_car.drive()
my_car.honk()
